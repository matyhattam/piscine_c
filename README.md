# 42 Core Curriculum Projects

This repository contains my work for the **42 core curriculum**.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to complete **all the core cursus projects of 42** while building strong and reliable fundamentals in programming.

I am currently working on this project to develop **very solid basics in C and C++**, with the objective of getting closer to **low-level programming** and eventually **embedded systems development**.

### Current Project

The current focus is on the **C Piscine exercises** provided by 42.
These exercises are designed to strengthen:
- C programming fundamentals
- Memory management and pointers
- Algorithmic thinking
- Low-level concepts and coding discipline

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise or project.
- Files follow the norms and requirements defined by 42.

## Status

🚧 In progress — C Piscine exercises.

## Notes

This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and tracking progress throughout the 42 core curriculum.
