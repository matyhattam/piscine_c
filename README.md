# 42 Core Curriculum Projects

I am currently working on this project to develop **very solid basics in C and C++**, with the objective of getting closer to **low-level programming** and eventually **embedded systems development**.

The 42 program is heavy on low-level programming using C/C++, that is why I am doing all this.
With 4 years of experience as a Python engineer, I always wanted to deep down, into low-lvl, system lvl programming, I thing that the 42 program is very good to reach this goal.

### Current Project

The current focus is on the **C Piscine exercises** provided by 42.
These exercises are designed to strengthen:
- C programming fundamentals
- Memory management and pointers
- Algorithmic thinking
- Low-level concepts and coding discipline

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise or project.
- Files follow the norms and requirements defined by 42.

## Status

🚧 In progress — C Piscine exercises.

## Notes

This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and tracking progress throughout the 42 core curriculum.
